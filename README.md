# Usage
The page displays a text area to the user with the button "Generate Password" below.
By pressing 'Generate Password,' the user is prompted with five messages/questions:

1) A password length between 8 and 128 characters
2) If the user wants to include special characters in their password: **!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~**
3) If the user wants to include numerical characters in their password: **0123456789**
4) If the user wants to include uppercase characters in their password: **ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ**
5) If the user wants to include lowercase characters in their password: **abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz**

Once all the prompts are cycled through, a password is generated for the user according to the criteria selected.
